Ludum Dare 37 Jam Entry

Drag and drop furniture to design your room. Make the prettiest layout, or try
to get the highest score you can.

The messages appearing at the top of the screen are hints about the secrets of
the scoring system. If you don't want to see them, press the green button in
the bottom left corner.

Works just as well on mobile as on desktop.

Even though this is a Jam entry, I was busy the first day and made it in 48
hours.
